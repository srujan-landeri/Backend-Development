# Backend Web Development

#### This repository contains all the files I created while practicing backend development. I aim to work on various technologies and frameworks like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL to build RESTful APIs, handle user authentication, and manage databases.

#### The code in this repository is meant for educational purposes only and is not meant to be used in production environments. Feel free to browse the files and use them as a reference for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
